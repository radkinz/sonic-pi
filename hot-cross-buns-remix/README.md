# hot cross buns remix

This audio begins with a really basic Hot Cross Buns song, and then the vinyl reverse sound drops which kicks into the true beat of the audio. 
Hot Cross Buns is a classic beginner song that reminds me of my elementary school days, when we were forced to learn the recorder.
Thus, I thought it was a great idea to use Hot Cross Buns as my first song in the Sonic Pi environment. As I continued to learn the Sonic Pi environment,
I figured out how to create more complex beats like the one in the ladder half of the audio. However, when composing my first full Sonic Pi song, I wanted
to keep the Hot Cross Buns part for nostalgia and to show myself how much improvement can happen even in one day of work.
